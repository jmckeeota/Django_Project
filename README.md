This project is a in-progress custom adaptation of the Django course [here](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-django-series) featuring my own imagined build-your-own-robot company.  It currently combines a number of technologies I've cultivated throughout my career:

Docker
1. A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment featuring a Django backend, a database, and a database administrator console
2. Mock data generated by [Mockaroo](mockaroo.com) and automatic SQL data deployment to the database
3. Automatic model migrations
4. Local-facing volumes for easy development

Django
1. Custom Django models demonstrating robust understanding of database relationship types and method overwriting
2. API endpoints for website resources via Django Rest Framework
3. [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and json-based token implementation via [Simple JWT](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
4. Distinct and clear separation of functions.  User authentication, likes, comments, and website resources are intentionally detatched for a modular development approach
5. Cutomized Django Admin console
6. Demonstration of care being taken to limit database calls

Instructions
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. From repository root, run "docker-compose up --build" and wait for build
3. Visit the APIs from localhost:8000/robots/
4. Visit the database administrator console at localhost:5001
    * Database = "db"
    * Username = "root"
    * Password = "Temporary_Password"
5. Visit the Django admin console here: localhost:8000/admin
    * Username = "admin"
    * Password = "Temporary_Password"
