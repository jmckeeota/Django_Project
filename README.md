This project is a custom project to demonstrate my ability with Django.  It combines a number of technologies I've cultivated throughout my career:

1. A backend using Django demonstrating models, migrations, and a customized admin site
2. Docker and Docker-Compose using a wait-for script to trigger the migrations after the database is ready
3. MySQL
