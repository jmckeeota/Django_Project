# Instructions
1. Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed and running and ports 8000 and 5001 are free on localhost
2. From repository root, run "docker-compose up --build."  It will take some time to import the SQL data in to the database.  You will see "Watching for file changes with StatReloader" in the Docker logs when it's ready to access.
3. Visit the APIs from http://localhost:8000/robots/
4. Visit the database administrator console at http://localhost:5001
    * Database = "db"
    * Username = "root"
    * Password = "Temporary_Password"
5. Visit the Django admin console here: http://localhost:8000/admin
    * Username = "admin"
    * Password = "Temporary_Password"

# Intro
This project features my own imagined build-your-own-robot company.  It combines a number of technologies I've cultivated throughout my career

### Docker
1. A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment featuring a Django backend, a database, and a database administrator console
2. Mock data generated by [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com) and automatic SQL data deployment to the database, including Django accounts.
3. Automatic model migrations
4. Local-facing volumes for easy development

### Django
1. Custom Django models demonstrating robust understanding of database relationship types and method overwriting
2. API endpoints for website resources via Django Rest Framework
3. [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and json-based token implementation via [Simple JWT](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
4. Distinct and clear separation of functions.  User authentication, likes, and website resources are intentionally detatched for a modular development approach
5. Cutomized Django Admin console
6. Demonstration of care being taken to limit database calls
